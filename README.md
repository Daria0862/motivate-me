MotivateMe
As a user, I want to be able to create a simple to-do list. I want to edit and delete tasks. The tasks should be saved when the I come back to the site. 
As a user, I want there to be a motivational quote that refreshes every time the page is reopened. The website is made with React using styled-components, reactstrap and bootstrap. It will also use Quotable API (quotable.io).

Description
MotivateMe motivates the user to complete their tasks. The website displays a motivational quote and displays the user's task in a grid. It allows the user to edit tasks and delete them. The tasks are saved using Local storage.

Usage
Copy this url("https://peppy-ganache-8ea561.netlify.app/"), paste on the browser, click on the "Create Task" then type in your task. Then click the "Create" button to save the task. The edit and delete icons can be used to edit and delete the tasks.

Here is the screenshot of what the form look like:
